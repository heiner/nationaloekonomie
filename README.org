* What is this?

  This is the German-language predecessor to the seminal
  Human Action: A Treatise on Economics by Ludwig von Mises,
  converted to ePub format.

* Why?

  Because I wanted to read it on my Android phone, and I wasn't
  happy with the existing digital editions.

  The inspiration for doing this, and most of my knowledge of the ePub
  format, comes from the [[https://github.com/ieure/sicp][ePub version of SICP by ieure]].

* How do I use it?

  This is the raw source for the book. If you’d just like to read it,
  you’ll find what you’re looking for [[https://github.com/heiner/nationaloekonomie/downloads][in the downloads tab]].

* What about the English version?

  The English-language version of this book is available in several
  formats at [[http://mises.org/document/3250][mises.org]].

* What’s left to do?

** TODO Fix HTML

** TODO Better footnotes

** Probably lots of other things
